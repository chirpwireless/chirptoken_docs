# Redeem NFT

## How to burn your Skyward Soarer NFT and Order a Blackbird miner on Chirp Platform?

For the best experience with the Skyward Soarer NFT burn process and the subsequent Blackbird miner order, it is highly recommended to use Suiet wallet or Sui wallet created using the classic method with a seed phrase. If your Skyward Soarer NFT is stored in a Sui wallet that was set up through Google or Twitch authorization, you will not be able to complete this process. In such a case, please contact our support team for assistance.

## Step One

Go to [https://app.chirpwireless.io](https://app.chirpwireless.io) and sign-in or sign-up (in case you don't have an account on Chirp).
