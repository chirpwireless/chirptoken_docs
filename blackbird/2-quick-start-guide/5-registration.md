# Blackbird Registration

## Step One (Connect to the Gateway's Wi-Fi Access Point)

After properly mounting your gateway, take your smartphone and open the "Wi-Fi Connections". If the gateway is powered on, you will see a Wi-Fi access point named "Chirp-XXXXXX" (XXXXXX represents gateway-specific numbers). Connect your phone to this access point. **Password is the same as the access point name Chirp-XXXXXX**.

It is strongly recommended to stay close to the gateway (around 5 meters) during the registration process to ensure a stable connection.
